# UnityMinesweeperProject

The main code is in Assets/TileGen.cs .

There was a stint in time where I was playing lots of minesweeper and I figured I could quickly code it myself in Unity. Most of my time was spent working on the recursive tile revealing algorithm and Unity provided the graphics so I didn't have to make my own GUI. What I have working so far plays like the classic minesweeper with flags and chording implemented. However, this project is not yet fully polished and finishedï¼› I still would like to add a menu for restarting and board size selection, a victory notification/screen for when you solve the board, a defeat notification/screen that locks the board when you click a mine, proper camera bounds, and more presentable graphic textures.
