# UnityMinesweeperProject

The main code is in Assets/TileGen.cs .

There was a stint in time where I was playing lots of minesweeper and I figured I could quickly code it myself in Unity. It took a while to figure out the recursive tile revealing algorithm but in the end it plays like the classic minesweeper with flags and chording implemented as well. I still have to add a menu for restarting and board size selection, and a victory notification/screen for when you solve the board.
